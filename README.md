Stylebot CSS file to enable Dark Mode on [OmniFocus3](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) web to match the Dark Mode on their macOS desktop app. While Dark Mode was a great addition to the desktop and mobile apps, the web app is stuck with a hybrid theme of Dark Mode sidebar and Light Mode body.

These settings change the web-app to look like the desktop app for uniformity.
